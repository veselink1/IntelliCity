# IntelliCity - All the info you need in one familiar place

#### Contributors - veselink1, lubomarinski

## About
IntelliCity is a website which doubles as a personalisable homepage (ala iGoogle). It allows you to make use of information cards to better plan your day and make use of all the smart systems that a city may have. The dashboard is entirely customisable to suit the users' preferences.

The website is built with ASP.NET Core 2.0, React.JS and TypeScript. Support for server-side rendering is also enabled. The project makes use of multiple APIs, including the Facebook Graph API, for getting relevant news, and the AccuWeather API, for showing the weather. All the other information shown in the cards below required custom scrappers to be made to make the information from municipal websites presentable in a different format.
